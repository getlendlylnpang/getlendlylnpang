If you are in need of quick cash for a short-term loan to get you through to your next payday, then a payday loan may be right for you. These are different than long-term loans, which are usually needed for large purchases, such as a car or a home improvement project. Instead, these are short-term loans, or payday loans, which are designed to help individuals when their next paycheck just can't come quickly enough.

The majority of payday loans range from $100 to $500, and most payday loans have a short timeline, usually less than two weeks.

Payday loans are used for a variety of household and personal expenses, and they are ideal for those individuals that may not have available credit or other means of acquiring cash for the short-term.

The following list details the most common reasons individuals seek payday loans:

1. Groceries - There are a few things that we simply cannot live without; groceries are one of them. Have you ever paid all of your monthly bills only to find out that you didn't leave enough for basic, household items and food? If so, then a short-term payday loan may be right for you.

2. Gas Money - With the rising cost of gasoline, many hardworking individuals have experienced a hard time paying their bills and putting gas in their cars. The bottom line for most people is that no gas equates to no job. We all need to put fuel in our vehicles so that we can get back and forth between work, pick our children up from school, and run errands, for example.
